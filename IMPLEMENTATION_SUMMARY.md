# Properties Page Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a simple card list of properties on the `/properties` route with basic create and delete functionality using React Query hooks.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Properties API Hooks (`src/hooks/api/properties.ts`)
- Added `useCreateProperty()` mutation hook for creating new properties
- Added `useDeleteProperty()` mutation hook for deleting properties
- Both hooks automatically invalidate the properties query cache on success

### 2. Updated Properties Page (`src/app/(dashboard)/properties/page.tsx`)
- Converted from server component to client component using `'use client'`
- Replaced server-side data fetching with React Query hooks:
  - `useProperties()` for fetching properties list
  - `useCreateProperty()` for creating properties
  - `useDeleteProperty()` for deleting properties
- Added loading states and error handling
- Implemented property cards using the existing UI components

### 3. Features Implemented

#### Property Cards
- **Card Layout**: Uses `Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardContent`, and `CardFooter` components
- **Property Information Display**:
  - Property label (or "Unnamed Property" if not set)
  - Address
  - Property type (SFH, TH, CONDO, etc.)
  - Square footage with proper formatting
  - Year built
- **Actions**:
  - "View Details" button linking to individual property page
  - "Delete" button with confirmation dialog

#### Create Property Functionality
- **Spoofed Default Data**: Uses a predefined `DEFAULT_PROPERTY` object with realistic sample data:
  ```typescript
  {
    address: '123 Sample Street, Sample City, ST 12345',
    data: {
      label: 'Sample Property',
      address: { line1: '123 Sample Street', city: 'Sample City', state: 'ST', zip: '12345' },
      property_type: 'SFH',
      sqft: 2000,
      year_built: 2005,
      stories: 2,
      areas: [
        { type: 'bedroom', quantity: 3 },
        { type: 'bathroom', quantity: 2 },
        { type: 'kitchen', quantity: 1 },
        { type: 'living_room', quantity: 1 }
      ],
      notes: 'Sample property created for demonstration'
    }
  }
  ```
- **Add Property Button**: 
  - Available in both empty state and when properties exist
  - Shows loading state during creation
  - Automatically refreshes the properties list after creation

#### Delete Property Functionality
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Uses `window.confirm()` for user confirmation
- **Loading State**: Shows loading indicator on delete button during operation
- **Automatic Refresh**: Updates the properties list after successful deletion

### 4. UI/UX Improvements
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators and messages
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages
- **Empty State**: Welcoming onboarding experience for first-time users
- **Responsive Design**: Grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes
- **Hover Effects**: Cards have subtle hover animations
- **Button States**: Disabled buttons during loading operations

### 5. Technical Implementation Details
- **Type Safety**: Uses proper TypeScript types from the existing schema
- **React Query Integration**: Proper cache management and optimistic updates
- **API Integration**: Works with existing API routes (`/api/properties` and `/api/property/[id]`)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling at both API and UI levels
- **Performance**: Efficient re-rendering with React Query's caching

## Dependencies
All functionality uses existing dependencies:
- `@tanstack/react-query` - For state management
- Existing UI components - For consistent design
- Existing API routes - For backend operations
- Existing type definitions - For type safety

## How to Test
1. Navigate to `/properties` route
2. If no properties exist, use the "Add Property" button in the welcome screen
3. If properties exist, use the "Add Property" button in the top-right corner
4. Delete properties using the "Delete" button on each card (with confirmation)
5. View property details using the "View Details" button

## Notes
- The implementation follows the project's established patterns and conventions
- All create operations use the spoofed default data as requested
- The UI is responsive and follows the existing design system
- Error handling and loading states provide good user experience
- Code is properly formatted and follows the project's linting rules
